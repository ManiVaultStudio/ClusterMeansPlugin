# Cluster Means Plugin

Plugin to compute mean values per dimension of cluster data sets for the [ManiVault](https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio/core) visual analytics framework.

Clone the repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio/ClusterMeansPlugin.git
```

## Usage
1. Right-click a cluster data set in the data hierarchy. 
2. Select a parent data set from which to compute means.

The cluster data set must uniquely and fully cover all indices of the data set from which means are to be computed.

This plugin also populates the mean and std value of the selected cluster data set internally.
